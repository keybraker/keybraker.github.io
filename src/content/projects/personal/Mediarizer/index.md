## Building, Installing and Using Mediarizer
  
### Prerequisites
1. Make sure you have downloaded `g++` (on macOS `clang++` which is installed alongside Xcode).
2. Download and install [Exiv2](https://www.exiv2.org/) on your computer.<br />
   **(!)** _if you want to sort videos as well do not forget to add_ `cmake .. -DEXIV2_VIDEO_ENABLE=On` _flag when building_
3. WIP: If you want to achieve better performance you should download OpenMP for multithreading.<br />
   **(!)** _Keep in mind that Mediarizer interacts with the filesystem so there will be only a slight performance improvement as the main bottleneck is the I/O_
  
### Build

1. Open a terminal windows and clone Mediarizer and move to directory

      ```bash
      $ git clone https://github.com/keybraker/Mediarizer.git && cd Mediarizer
      ```

2. Compile Mediarizer

      ```bash
      $ make
      ```

3. Run Mediarizer ([examples](#3-2))

      ```bash
      $ ./mediarizer ...
      ```
  
### Clean

1. In the Mediarizer folder type

      ```bash
      $ make clean
      ```

> a. Multiple flags can be used in conjunction<br />
> b. Multiple file types([image](https://dev.exiv2.org/projects/exiv2/wiki/Supported_image_formats), [video](https://dev.exiv2.org/projects/exiv2/wiki/Supported_video_formats)) can be used as comma-separated string ex: -type jpg,png<br />
> c. Duplicate photos are compared by type, size, date and resolution, only than are they categorized as same<br />

### Examples

1. sort single file

      ```bash
      $ ./mediarizer -i /path/media.file -o /path/to/store/folder
      $ ./mediarizer --input /path/media.file --output /path/to/store/folder
      ```

2. sort directory

      ```bash
      $ ./mediarizer -i /path/folder -o /path/to/store/folder
      $ ./mediarizer --input /path/folder --output /path/to/store/folder
      ```

3. sort directory and encapsulated directories

      ```bash
      $ ./mediarizer -i /path/folder -o /path/to/store/folder -r
      ```

4. flags can be used in any order

      ```bash
      $ ./mediarizer -o /path/to/store/folder -D -i /path/source/folder -f mp4,jpg,png
      ```

5. this execution will only sort _mp4_ and _jpg_ files to move direcotry

      ```bash
      $ ./mediarizer -i  /path/source/folder -o /path/to/store/folder -f mp4,jpg
      ```

6. will only copy photos, _not_ videos:

      ```bash
      $ ./mediarizer -i /path/source/folder -o /path/to/store/folder -photo
      ```

### Additional Information

> a. photos without exif data can be organized with date of creation in the file system using flag `-D`<br />
> b. when two photos have the same name, only the first encountered is moved to new directory<br />
> c. unsupported files are not being copied<br />
> d. corructed files may cause the program to crash<br />
> e. using cloud storage services like (iCloud, OneDrive, Dropbox, etc) may result in unexpected behaviour 
as data is actually only on remote servers and you locally can see a shortcut of the remote file
